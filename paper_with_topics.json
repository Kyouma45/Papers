Although recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize specific RAG components, these approaches often focus on overly simplistic pipelines with only two components or do not adequately address the complex interdependencies and collaborative interactions among the modules. To overcome these challenges, we propose treating the RAG pipeline as a multi-agent cooperative task, with each component regarded as an RL agent. Specifically, we present MMOA-RAG, a Multi-Module joint Optimization Algorithm for RAG, which employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to harmonize all agents' goals towards a unified reward, such as the F1 score of the final answer. Experiments conducted on various QA datasets demonstrate that MMOA-RAG improves the overall pipeline performance and outperforms existing baselines. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of individual components and the adaptability of MMOA-RAG across different RAG components and datasets.

Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives.\nOur empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.", "Month": "2024-09"}, {"Title": "VideoRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Video Corpus", "Reading Status": "Want to Read", "Date Added": "2025-01-10", "Link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05874", "Topics": [], "Description": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy to address the issue of generating factually incorrect outputs in foundation models by retrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into their generation process. However, existing RAG approaches have primarily focused on textual information, with some recent advancements beginning to consider images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing events, processes, and contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While a few recent studies explore the integration of videos in the response generation process, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieving them according to queries, or convert videos into the textual descriptions without harnessing their multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a novel framework that not only dynamically retrieves relevant videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information of videos in the output generation. Further, to operationalize this, our method revolves around the recent advance of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and seamless integration of the retrieved videos jointly with queries. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is superior to relevant baselines.", "Month": "2025-01"}, {"Title": "YOLOv10: Real-Time End-to-End Object Detection", "Reading Status": "Want to Read", "Date Added": "2024-05-23", "Link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14458", "Topics": ["YOLO", "Technical Report"], "Description": "Over the past years, YOLOs have emerged as the predominant paradigm in the field of real-time object detection owing to their effective balance between computational cost and detection performance. Researchers have explored the architectural designs, optimization objectives, data augmentation strategies, and others for YOLOs, achieving notable progress. However, the reliance on the non-maximum suppression (NMS) for post-processing hampers the end-to-end deployment of YOLOs and adversely impacts the inference latency. Besides, the design of various components in YOLOs lacks the comprehensive and thorough inspection, resulting in noticeable computational redundancy and limiting the model's capability. It renders the suboptimal efficiency, along with considerable potential for performance improvements. In this work, we aim to further advance the performance-efficiency boundary of YOLOs from both the post-processing and model architecture. To this end, we first present the consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training of YOLOs, which brings competitive performance and low inference latency simultaneously. Moreover, we introduce the holistic efficiency-accuracy driven model design strategy for YOLOs. We comprehensively optimize various components of YOLOs from both efficiency and accuracy perspectives, which greatly reduces the computational overhead and enhances the capability. The outcome of our effort is a new generation of YOLO series for real-time end-to-end object detection, dubbed YOLOv10. Extensive experiments show that YOLOv10 achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across various model scales. For example, our YOLOv10-S is 1.8\u00d7 faster than RT-DETR-R18 under the similar AP on COCO, meanwhile enjoying 2.8\u00d7 smaller number of parameters and FLOPs. Compared with YOLOv9-C, YOLOv10-B has 46\\% less latency and 25\\% fewer parameters for the same performance.", "Month": "2024-05"}, {"Title": "YOLOv12: Attention-Centric Real-Time Object Detectors", "Reading Status": "Read", "Date Added": "2025-02-18", "Link": "https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.12524", "Topics": ["YOLO", "Technical Report"], "Description": "Enhancing the network architecture of the YOLO framework has been crucial for a long time, but has focused on CNN-based improvements despite the proven superiority of attention mechanisms in modeling capabilities. This is because attention-based models cannot match the speed of CNN-based models. This paper proposes an attention-centric YOLO framework, namely YOLOv12, that matches the speed of previous CNN-based ones while harnessing the performance benefits of attention mechanisms. YOLOv12 surpasses all popular real-time object detectors in accuracy with competitive speed. For example, YOLOv12-N achieves 40.6% mAP with an inference latency of 1.64 ms on a T4 GPU, outperforming advanced YOLOv10-N / YOLOv11-N by 2.1%/1.2% mAP with a comparable speed. This advantage extends to other model scales. YOLOv12 also surpasses end-to-end real-time detectors that improve DETR, such as RT-DETR / RT-DETRv2: YOLOv12-S beats RT-DETR-R18 / RT-DETRv2-R18 while running 42% faster, using only 36% of the computation and 45% of the parameters.

Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer than their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous the state-of-the-art at context window extension.
